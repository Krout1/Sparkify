### Overview:
The Sparkify captsone project is my final project to finish my Data Scientist Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project I will show all of my learned skill from reading data to predicting values or behavior.

Sparkify is a music app where million of users stream their songs with. Therefore, Sparkify offers 2 different usage models
- Free-trial — free to use and commercial financed
- Premium Subscription Plan — Pay for Usage of Sparkify
Hence, users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their subscription at any time. Thus, the main goal of the project is to predict the users, who are predicted to churn their subscription.
